4093 Drone Synth

Circuit notes:

Basic audio signal is generated by 4 NAND Gate astable oscillators, which is then mixed together by a summing amplifier and continuing to a final master volume potentiometer for output level control.   The NAND Gate oscillators are modulated by 555 astable oscillators labeled OSCILLATOR GATE on the schematic.  The 555 was chosen to be used due to the unique CV input feature of the chip.  Otherwise, the design can be reduced to another 4 oscillators to perform the gating of the 4 main audio oscillators.

The output of the oscillators can be routed via a Mix potentiometer (MIX) to either CV Output or Audio Output, which each have a potentiometer for leveling.  CV Outputs from each oscillator have a Level potentiometer and a mono output jack.  This complements the mono jack on each 555 timer's CV input.
  
The 555 timer can be turned off individually (ENABLE) or with the oscillator using a DPDT switch.

Input voltage should be anywhere from 5-12V, but can be higher depending on the ICs used.  There is no regulator in this circuit, but it can easily be added later.  The LM317 is an excellent choice to vary the range from 1.2V to near 30V.

Power supply is filtered with 100uF & 0.1uF filter caps, positioned closely to the physical power supply grounding.

IC power supply filter caps are grouped for less clutter in the schematic.

Status LED signals whether or not the circuit is receiving power (On/Off).

Power is supplied to the circuit by either 9V battery or AC Adapter (8V minimum).  

Output volume is adjusted via a 100kA potentiometer and is adjusted via resistors for line-level.

All ICs are decoupled with 0.1uF capacitors.

The TL072 amplifier should be positioned far away from the oscillators and 555 timers to avoid any excessive signal to appear on the main audio line.
